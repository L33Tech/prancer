Ever heard of Black? This is the opposite.
<hr>

A tool to turn your clean python code into a hideous mess.

# Features

1. Turn all comments into Pitbull lyrics ðŸ’ƒ
2. Turn all your variable names into a mixture of animal sounds and horribly similar looking characters like "bark_bark_0OO0O". 
3. Code still compiles after all these _improvements_! ðŸ‘·


# Example

Before:
```python
# function that adds two numbers
def addition(a: int, b: int) -> int:

    # find sum
    result = a + b

    # return the sum
    return result


if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("Sum of 1 and 3 is %s" % addition(1, 3))

```

After:
```python
# there's nothing like Miami's heat
def quack_Il1Î™1l (squeak_squeak_IIÎ™Î™lI :int ,honk_honk_honk_aaÎ±aÎ± :int )->int :

# Bada bing, bada boom
    growl_growl_growl_Î±Î±aaÎ± =squeak_squeak_IIÎ™Î™lI +honk_honk_honk_aaÎ±aÎ± 

    # Hey baby, givin' it your all when you're dancin' on me
    return growl_growl_growl_Î±Î±aaÎ± 


if __name__ =='__main__':
    print ("Sum of 1 and 3 is %s"%quack_Il1Î™1l (1 ,3 ))

```
