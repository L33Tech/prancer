# lancer

A tool to turn your clean python code into a hideous mess.

Ever heard of Black? This is the opposite.

# Features

1. Turn all comments into Pitbull lyrics ðŸ’ƒ
2. Turn all your variable names into a mixture of animal sounds and horribly similar looking characters like "bark_bark_0OO0O".
3. Translates all docstrings into Klingon.
4. Code still compiles after all these _improvements_! ðŸ‘·


# Example

Before:
```python
# function that adds two numbers


def addition(a: int, b: int) -> int:

    # find sum
    result = a + b

    # return the sum
    return result


if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("The sum of 2 and 5 is ", addition(2, 5))

```

After:
```python


```
