# Prancer
Ever heard of [Black](https://github.com/psf/black)? This is the opposite.
A tool to turn your clean python code into a hideous (working) mess.

## Features
1. Turn all comments into lines from My Little Pony.
2. Turn all your variable names into a mixture of pony names and horribly similar looking characters like "Twilight_Dash_0OO0O".
3. Add irritating white spaces.
4. Code still runs after all these _improvements_! ðŸ‘·


## Example
Before:
```python


# function that adds two numbers
def addition(a: int, b: int) -> int:

    # find sum
    result = a + b

    # return the sum
    return result


if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("Sum of 1 and 3 is %s" % addition(1, 3))

```

After:
```python

# TODO Add this example

```

## Installation and Usage
Simply run `pip install git+https://github.com/L33Tech/prancer.git` and then use the `prance` command line tool.

```
usage: prance [-h] [--version] -f ./FILE_PATH.py [-y]

Ever heard of Black? This is the opposite.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -f ./FILE_PATH.py, --file ./FILE_PATH.py
                        Python file to be prance'd.
  -y, --yolo            Overwrite original file, lol.
```

So if you have a python file at `./test.py`, you simply run `prance -f ./test.py`

## How does it work
The key tool we use it the `tokenizer` standard module in python. It allows us to tokenize any python script which then in turn makes substituting comments and variable names fairly simple.

## Contribute
Bug reports, fixes and additional features are always welcome! Make sure to run the tests with `python setup.py test` and write your own for new features. Thanks.
